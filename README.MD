CampusFuel Budget Tracker is a simple, student-focused web application designed to help university and college students take control of their daily food and drinks spending on campus. The idea behind CampusFuel is to solve a common problem many students face: losing track of small café, snack, and meal purchases that quickly add up throughout the semester. The platform provides a clean and intuitive interface where users can log each food purchase, including the vendor, meal type, cost and date. A running total of all recorded expenses gives students instant insight into their spending habits, helping them make more informed budgeting decisions. Visually, the application uses a clear table, categorized items list and modern Bootstrap design elements to make the experience both functional and engaging. A splash-style home page introduces the purpose of the tool, while a list view displays all logged expenses in a neatly organized table. CRUD functionality allows students to effortlessly create, view, edit, and delete entries. By focusing on a relatable campus lifestyle challenge and providing an accessible way to monitor food costs, CampusFuel Budget Tracker aims to empower students with better financial awareness. 
## App.css and styling
-Orange and Green Color Scheme - Used orange (#f97316) for primary elements (navbar, headers, main buttons) and green (#16a34a) for "Add" actions to create an energetic, food-related theme with clear visual hierarchy.

-Clean, Flat Design - Avoided gradients and animations in favor of solid colors and simple hover effects for a modern, distraction-free interface that keeps focus on the content.

-Rounded App Icon Logo - Applied 25px border-radius with subtle shadows to the logo, giving it a contemporary mobile app icon appearance that strengthens branding.

-Color-Coded Category Badges - Used distinct colors (green for Meal, orange for Snack, blue for Drink, purple for Other) to make expense categories instantly recognizable at a glance.

-Mobile-Responsive Layout - Added media queries at 768px and 991px breakpoints to ensure buttons, navigation, and tables adapt properly for tablet and mobile viewing.
