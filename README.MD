CampusFuel Budget Tracker is a simple, student-focused web application designed to help university and college students take control of their daily food and drinks spending on campus. The idea behind CampusFuel is to solve a common problem many students face: losing track of small café, snack, and meal purchases that quickly add up throughout the semester. The platform provides a clean and intuitive interface where users can log each food purchase, including the vendor, meal type, cost and date. A running total of all recorded expenses gives students instant insight into their spending habits, helping them make more informed budgeting decisions. Visually, the application uses a clear table, categorized items list and modern Bootstrap design elements to make the experience both functional and engaging. A splash-style home page introduces the purpose of the tool, while a list view displays all logged expenses in a neatly organized table. CRUD functionality allows students to effortlessly create, view, edit, and delete entries. By focusing on a relatable campus lifestyle challenge and providing an accessible way to monitor food costs, CampusFuel Budget Tracker aims to empower students with better financial awareness.
